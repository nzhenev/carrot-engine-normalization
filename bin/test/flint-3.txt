Thus a large monetary value can be concentrated into a small volume of notes. 
------INPUT------
This facilitates crimes which deal in cash, including money laundering, drug dealing and tax evasion. 
------INPUT------
There have been calls to withdraw the note for this reason. 
------INPUT------
However, some of the replaced currencies had widely-used high-value notes, including 10,000 Belgian francs, 5000 Austrian schillings, 1000 Dutch guilders, and 1000 Deutsche Marks. 
------INPUT------
Spain in particular now has a quarter of all these high-value bills within its borders. 
------INPUT------
This is far more than expected for an economy of its size and they are rarely seen in every-day commerce – they have been nicknamed "bin Ladens" by the populace (as everyone knows they are there and what they look like but they have never seen them). 
------INPUT------
British and Spanish police are using the bills to track money laundering. 
------INPUT------
As of 20 April 2010, money exchange offices in the United Kingdom stopped selling € 500 notes due to their use in money laundering. 
------INPUT------
The Serious Organised Crime Agency claimed that "90%of all € 500notes sold in the UK are in the hands of organised crime", revealed during an eight month analysis. 
------INPUT------
The € 500 note is worth in the region of £430 depending on exchange rates (more than eight times the value of the Bank of England's largest publicly-circulated note), and had become the currency choice for gangs to hide their profits. 
------INPUT------
The EU directive 2005/06 ECon the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing tries to prevent such crime by requiring banks, real estate agents and many more companies to investigate and report usage of cash in excess of € 15,000.

------INPUT------
It is the Eurosystem’s task to ensure an efficient and smooth supply of euro notes and to maintain their integrity. 
------INPUT------
Environmental impact As an environment-friendly institution, the European Central Bank tries very hard to make a shrewd use of natural resources, to keep the quality of the world and to save people's health in the produce and supplying of euro notes. 
------INPUT------
Euro notes are safe to use: independent test results confirmed that euro notes fulfilled all European Union regulations including a large range of chemical substances in euro notes. 
------INPUT------
All substances in the notes have shown a concentration below any limit. 
------INPUT------
Tracking There are several communities of hobbyists, such as EuroBillTracker, which track the euro notes as they pass through their hands, to record their numbers and monitor their travel. 
------INPUT------
Their aim is to record details about its spread and to generate statistics and rankings for various notes. 
------INPUT------
EuroBillTracker had registered over 96 million notes as of October 2011.
