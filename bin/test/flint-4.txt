------INPUT------
These vales are primarily used for dairy agriculture, dotted with small villages, farms and coppices. 
------INPUT------
They include the Blackmore Vale (Stour valley) and Frome valley. 
------INPUT------
South-east Dorset, around Poole and Bournemouth, lies on very nonresistant Eocene clays (mainly London Clay and Gault Clay), sands and gravels. 
------INPUT------
These thin soils support a heathland habitat which supports all seven native British reptile species. 
------INPUT------
The River Frome estuary runs through this weak rock, and its many tributaries have carved out a very wide estuary. 
------INPUT------
At the mouth of the estuary sand spits have been deposited turning the estuary into Poole Harbour, the second largest natural harbour in the world (after Sydney Harbour, though Sydney's claim is disputed). 
------INPUT------
The harbour is very shallow in places and contains a number of islands, notably Brownsea Island, famous for its Red Squirrel sanctuary and as the birthplace of the Scouting movement. 
------INPUT------
The harbour, and the chalk and limestone hills of the Purbecks to the south, lie atop Britain's largest onshore oil field. 
------INPUT------
The field, operated by BP from Wytch Farm, produces a high-quality oil and boasts the world's oldest continuously pumping well (Kimmeridge, since the early 1960s) and longest horizontal drill (5 miles, ending underneath Bournemouth pier). 
------INPUT------
The clay pottery produced by Poole Pottery from the local clays is famous for its quality. 
------INPUT------
Most of Dorset's coastline was designated a World Heritage Site in 2001because of its unique geological landforms. 
------INPUT------
The coast documents the entire Mesozoic era from Triassic to Cretaceous, and has yielded many important fossils, including the first complete Ichthyosaur and fossilised Jurassic trees. 
------INPUT------
The coast also features examples of most notable coastal landforms, including a textbook example of cove (Lulworth Cove) and natural arch. Jutting out into the English Channel is a limestone island, the Isle of Portland, connected to the mainland by Chesil Beach, a tombolo. 
------INPUT------
In the west of the county the chalk and clay of south-east England begin to give way to the marl and granite of neighbouring Devon. 
------INPUT------
Pilsdon Pen, the highest hill in Dorset at 909ft (277m), is situated here. History 
------INPUT------
The earliest recorded use of the name was in A.D.940 as Dorseteschire meaning the dwellers (saete) of Dornuuarana (Dorchester), the place of fisticuffs (Celtic: Dwrn, "fist" and gwarae, "play"). 
------INPUT------
The first known settlement of Dorset was by Mesolithic hunters, from around 8000 BCE. 
------INPUT------
Their populations were small and concentrated along the coast in the Isle of Purbeck, Weymouth and Chesil Beach and along the Stour valley. 
------INPUT------
These populations used tools and fire to clear these areas of some of the native Oak forest. 
------INPUT------
Dorset's high chalk hills have provided a location for defensive settlements for millennia, with neolithic and bronze age burial mounds on almost every chalk hill in the county, and a number of iron age hill forts, the most famous being Maiden Castle. 
------INPUT------
The chalk downs would have been deforested in these times, making way for farmland. 
------INPUT------
Dorset has many notable Roman artifacts, particularly around the Roman town Dorchester, where Maiden Castle was captured from the Celtic Durotriges by Vespasian in AD 54, early in the Roman occupation. 
------INPUT------
Roman roads radiated from Dorchester, following the tops of the chalk ridges to the many small Roman villages around the county. 
------INPUT------
In the Roman era, settlements moved from the hill tops to the valleys, and the hilltops had been abandoned by the 4th century. 
------INPUT------
A large defensive ditch, Bokerley Dyke, delayed the Saxon conquest of Dorset from the north east for up to 200 years. 
------INPUT------
The Domesday Book documents many Saxon settlements corresponding to modern towns and villages, mostly in the valleys. 
------INPUT------
There have been few changes to the parishes since the Domesday Book. 
------INPUT------
Over the next few centuries the settlers established the pattern of farmland which prevailed into the 19th century, as well as many monasteries, which were important landowners and centres of power. 
------INPUT------
In the 12th century civil war, Dorset was fortified with the construction of the defensive castles at Corfe Castle, Powerstock, Wareham and Shaftesbury, and the strengthening of the monasteries such as at Abbotsbury. 
------INPUT------
In the 17th century English Civil War, Dorset had a number of royalist strongholds, such as Sherborne Castle and Corfe Castle, which were ruined in the war. 
------INPUT------
In the intervening years, the county was used by the monarchy and nobility for hunting and the county still have a number of Deer Parks. 
------INPUT------
Throughout the late Medieval times, the remaining hilltop settlements shrank further and disappeared. 
------INPUT------
From the Tudor to Georgian periods, farms specialised and the monastic estates were broke up, leading to an increase in population and settlement size. 
------INPUT------
During the industrial revolution, Dorset remained largely rural and still retains its agricultural economy. 
------INPUT------
The Tolpuddle Martyrs lived in Dorset, and the farming economy of Dorset was central in the formation of the trade union movement. 
------INPUT------
Trade, industry and tourism The principal industry in Dorset has traditionally been agriculture. 
------INPUT------
It has not, however, been the largest employer for many decades as mechanisation has substantially reduced the number of workers required. 
------INPUT------
Agriculture has become less profitable in recent years and the industry has declined further. 
------INPUT------
In 2002, 1903km² of the county was in agricultural use, down from 1986km² in 1989, although the figure has fluctuated somewhat. 
------INPUT------
Cattle, the principal animal stock in the county, fell from 240413 to 178328 in the same period, the dairy herds falling from 102589to 73476. 
------INPUT------
Sheep and pig farming has declined in a similar fashion. Tourism has grown as a major industry in Dorset since the early 19th century. 
------INPUT------
4.2 million British tourists and 260000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2002, spending a combined total of £768 million. 
------INPUT------
Foreign tourism declined in 1999(310000, down from 410000 in 1998), and again in 2002(down from 320000), the latter decline being blamed on the effects of the global economy and security at that time. 
------INPUT------
Dorset has little manufacturing industry, at 14.6% of employment (compared to 18.8% for the UK), and is ranked 30th out the 34English counties. 
------INPUT------
The gross domestic product for the county is 84% that of the national average. 
------INPUT------
Dorset people Dorset is famed in literature for being the native county of author and poet Thomas Hardy. 
------INPUT------
Many of the places he describes in his novels in the fictional Wessex are in Dorset. 
------INPUT------
The National Trust own Thomas Hardy's Cottage, in woodland east of Dorchester, and Max Gate, his house in Dorchester. 
------INPUT------
Stalbridge was home of Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
------INPUT------
Poet William Barnes, authors Theodore Francis Powys, John le Carré, P.D. James and satirical novelist Thomas Love Peacock are also locals.
