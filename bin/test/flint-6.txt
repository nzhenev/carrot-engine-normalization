------INPUT------
The element is normally found in association with other base metals such as copper and lead in ores. 
------INPUT------
Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers to bond with sulfides. 
------INPUT------
Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. 
------INPUT------
Sphalerite, which is a form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc. 
------INPUT------
Other minerals, from which zinc is extracted, include smithsonite (zinc carbonate), hemimorphite (zinc silicate), wurtzite (another zinc sulfide), and sometimes hydrozincite (basic zinc carbonate). 
------INPUT------
With the exception of wurtzite, all these other minerals were formed as a result of weathering processes on the primordial zinc sulfides. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. 
------INPUT------
Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. 
------INPUT------
At the current rate of consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. 
------INPUT------
About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. 
------INPUT------
Section 1.3 Isotopes Five isotopes of zinc occur in nature. 
------INPUT------
64 Zn is the most abundant isotope (48.63%natural abundance). 
------INPUT------
This isotope has such a long half-life, at 4.3x10^18 years, that its radioactivity can be ignored. 
------INPUT------
Similarly, 70Zn (0.6%), with a half-life of 1.3x10^16 years is not usually considered to be radioactive. 
------INPUT------
The other isotopes found in nature are 66Zn (28%), 67Zn (4%) and 68Zn (19%). 
------INPUT------
Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized. 65Zn, which has a half-life of 243.66 days, is the most long-lived isotope, followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours. 
------INPUT------
Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers. 
------INPUT------
69m Zn has the longest half-life, 13.76h. 
------INPUT------
The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope. 
------INPUT------
The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray. 
------INPUT------
61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two. 
------INPUT------
The isotopes 65Zn, 71Zn, 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state. 
------INPUT------
The most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with a mass number lower than 66is electron capture. 
------INPUT------
The decay product resulting from electron capture is an isotope of copper. 
------INPUT------
The most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with mass number higher than 66is beta decay (_–), which produces an isotope of gallium. 
------INPUT------
Section 2 Creation Zinc is too large and heavy to form in stars using the silicon burning process. 
------INPUT------
The stable form of zinc is created in supernovas via the r-process. 
------INPUT------
Section 3 Compounds and chemistry Section 3.1 Reactivity Zinc has an electron configuration of [Ar]3d104s2 and is a member of the group 12of the periodic table. 
------INPUT------
It is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent. 
------INPUT------
The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate, Zn 5(OH) 6(CO 3) 2, by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide. 
------INPUT------
This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water. 
------INPUT------
Zinc burns in air with a bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of zinc oxide. 
------INPUT------
Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals. 
------INPUT------
Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room temperature with acids. 
------INPUT------
Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas. 
------INPUT------
The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2oxidation state. 
------INPUT------
When compounds in this oxidation state are formed the outer shell s electrons are lost, which yields a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [Ar]3d10. 
------INPUT------
This allows for the formation of four covalent bonds by accepting four electron pairs and thus obeying the octet rule. 
------INPUT------
The stereochemistry is therefore tetrahedral and the bonds may be described as being formed from sp3 hybrid orbitals on the zinc ion. 
------INPUT------
In aqueous solution an octahedral complex, [Zn(H2O) 6]2+ is the predominant species. 
------INPUT------
The volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285°C indicates the formation of Zn2Cl2, a zinc compound with a +1oxidation state. 
------INPUT------
No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than +1 or +2 are known. 
------INPUT------
Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist. 
------INPUT------
Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell, so its compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. 
------INPUT------
The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. 
------INPUT------
Because of this some of their salts have the same crystal structure and in circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor zinc and magnesium chemistries have much in common. 
------INPUT------
Otherwise there is little similarity. 
------INPUT------
Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and it forms much more stable complexes with N and S donors. 
------INPUT------
Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known. 
------INPUT------
