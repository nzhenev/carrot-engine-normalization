Before the introduction The euro was founded at the date of January 1st 1999, after which it began being the currency of over 300 million Europeans.
------INPUT------
For the first three years of its existence it was a currency which was used only in accounting.

Euro banknotes and coins were introduced on January 1st 2002, and on that day it replaced the former cash of the eurozone 12 , as it was then, national currencies like the Irish Pound and the Austrian schilling.
------INPUT------
After the introduction The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28February 2002.
