------INPUT------
This can be demonstrated as follows: If the user requests a page of the site, but the request contains no cookie, the server presumes that this is the first page visited by the user; the server creates a random string and sends it as a cookie back to the browser together with the requested page; From this point on, the cookie will automatically be sent by the browser to the server every time a new page from the site is requested; the server sends the page as usual, but also stores the URL of the requested page, the date/time of the request, and the cookie in a log file.

For example, to access the page http://www.example.org/index.html, browsers connect to the server www.example.org sending it a request that looks like the following one: The server replies by sending the requested page preceded by a similar packet of text, called 'HTTP response'.
------OUTPUT------
For example, to access the page http colon slash slash www dot example dot org slash index dot html, browsers connect to the server www dot example dot org sending it a request that looks like the following one: The server replies by sending the requested page preceded by a similar packet of text, called quote HTTP response end quote.

For example, the browserrequests the page http://www.example.org/spec.html by sending the server www.example.org a request like the following: This is a request for another page from the same server, and differs from the first one above because it contains the string that the server has previously sent to the browser.
------OUTPUT------
For example, the browser requests the page http colon slash slash www dot example dot org slash spec dot html by sending the server www dot example dot org a request like the following: This is a request for another page from the same server, and differs from the first one above because it contains the string that the server has previously sent to the browser.
------INPUT------
This way, the server knows that this request is related to the previous one.
